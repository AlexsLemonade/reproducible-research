To update the setup instructions, please modify one of the files rrp-setup.md or openrrp-setup.md.
Do not modify this file!

This will be a hands-on workshop, so to maximize our time, we would like you to arrive having completed a number of setup tasks, namely setting up accounts and installing software that we will be using.

We will _not_ have time to do all of the setup on the day of the workshop and accomplish all of our goals for the workshop!
Please be aware this setup process may take 1-2 hours to complete.

{% if site.workshop == "rrp" %}
    {% include_relative rrp-setup.md %}
{% elsif site.workshop == "openrrp" %}
    {% include_relative openrrp-setup.md %}
{% endif %}


If you need any assistance with the installation, do not hesitate to reach out to the Data Lab team by email, or, even better, in the [Cancer Data Science Slack](http://ccdatalab.org/slack)!
We will add you to a training-specific channel after you join the Slack community.
