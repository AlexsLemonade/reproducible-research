You will need to install R, RStudio, several R packages, GitKraken, and a suitable text editor, as well as any system dependencies required for these programs.
For Windows users, you will also need to install Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL 2).

You may already have some of this software installed, but we encourage you to read through all of the instructions at the links below that pertain to your system.
This is especially important for Windows users given the WSL 2 setup.

Please follow the instructions below for your given operating system:

- [macOS installation instructions](mac_installation_instructions.html) <!-- links must be .html since file is rendered via %include% -->
- [Windows installation instructions](windows_installation_instructions.html)

As part of this setup, you will also need to create a [GitHub.com](https://github.com) account if you do not already have one.
You will also need to [configure the GitKraken application](github_gitkraken_setup_instructions.html) to interact with GitHub.
