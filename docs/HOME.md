Participants can choose to continue the workshop and learn how to put their skills to use for the [Open Single-cell Pediatric Cancer Atlas (OpenScPCA)](https://openscpca.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), a pediatric cancer research project organized by the Data Lab.
We will teach you how to contribute and we'll get you completely set up so you can dive right into analysis as soon as the workshop ends!
