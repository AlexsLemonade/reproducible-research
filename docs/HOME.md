This pilot workshop will introduce concepts in reproducible computational research for genomics, including tools and approaches for organizing, managing, and sharing your code.

Before the workshop starts, be sure to visit our [Pre-workshop Setup page](setup_instructions/setup_overview.md) for instructions on preparing your computer for the workshop.
_Completing these setup steps is **required** for full participation in the hands-on activities._

You will also want to review the [Participant Information](participant_information.md) page for details about the workshop location and other logistics.


**Looking for more?** 
We have compiled a set of [useful resources](reproducibility_resources.md) that support reproducible computational research that we recommend for your future reading and exploration!
