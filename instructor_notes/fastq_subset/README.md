These FASTQ files are subsetted versions (to only the first 10,000 reads) of the full files here: https://trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/sra/?study=SRP255885

These files are obtained and processed with `generate_fastq_subsets.sh`, and they can be used as alternative FASTQ files to download when internet speed is prohibitive.
