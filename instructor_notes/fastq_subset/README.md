These FASTQ files are subsetted versions (to only the first 10,000 reads) of two of the samples from this project: https://trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/sra/?study=SRP255885.

Files are obtained from EBI and processed with `generate_fastq_subsets.sh`, and they can be used as alternative FASTQ files to download when internet speed is prohibitive.
