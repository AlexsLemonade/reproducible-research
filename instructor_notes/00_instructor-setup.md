This is only a matter of personal preference; it is _not required_.

  * [ ] Any password managers needed for credentials (e.g. 1Password for `git` authentication)
  * [ ] R/RStudio
  * [ ] `git` (via command line tools, if working on a Mac)
  * [ ] GitKraken (you should also be signed into your account)
  * [ ] [KeyCastr](https://github.com/keycastr/keycastr) for keystroke visualization.
  _Ensure this is turned on while teaching live demos!_
* [ ] Install the following R packages:
  * `here`, `tidyverse`, `rmarkdown`, `renv`, and `optparse`
