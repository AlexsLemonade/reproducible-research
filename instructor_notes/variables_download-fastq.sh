############### Downloading files with curl ###################
##### A few alternative approaches for downloading with curl are shown below, with R1 for example. 
##### Depending on how the workshop is moving along, multiple versions can be optionally introduced.
##### The versions shown below will place the downloaded file into the destination directory 
#####    as part of the same step without needing a separate line to mv.
##### For any version, you can always add `-s` to keep it quiet!

# Approach 2: Download directly to the location you want
#curl $FASTQ_URL/$FASTQ_R1 > $FASTQ_DEST/$FASTQ_R1

# Approach 3: Same as above, but without stdout
#curl $FASTQ_URL/$FASTQ_R1 -o $FASTQ_DEST/$FASTQ_R1
